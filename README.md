  ## Overview
The diagram below outlines the high-level architecture of the pipeline, illustrating the data flow from Data source to the visualization layer.

  ## The Goal
  The end goal of the current project is to preprocess the data on gcp platform and get useful insights from it.

  ## The dataset
This project uses free and reliable weather üåç data from the [Open-Meteo APIs](https://open-meteo.com/):

- **ENSEMBLE Weather API** ‚Äì Aggregated short-term forecasts from multiple global models.
- **Historical Weather API** ‚Äì Daily historical data (temperature, rainfall, etc.) from global reanalysis datasets (e.g., ERA5, MERRA-2).
- **Climate Change API** ‚Äì Long-term projections based on IPCC climate scenarios.

These APIs are RESTful, require no authentication, and are ideal for large-scale data collection and analysis.

### üîó Example Request

```bash
# Historical weather data for Antananarivo, Madagascar (2023)

  ## Data modeling
 We are going to build a **Star Schema** which comprises one fact and multiple dimension tables for our Data Warehouse.

The Entity Relational Diagram (ERD) for the final Data Warehouse is represented in the following image:

  ## Dashboard Overview
### üìä Climate & Weather Insights

The dashboard provides a clear, interactive view of weather and climate data collected from Open-Meteo APIs. It is designed to support climate risk analysis, decision-making, and model comparisons over time and geography.

### üéØ Key Features

- **Dynamic Filters**: Filter by date range, region/location, and climate model/scenario.
- **KPI Summary Cards**: Quickly view key climate indicators including:
  - Average Maximum Temperature (¬∞C)
  - Total Precipitation (mm)
  - Wind Speed and Solar Radiation
  - Temperature and Precipitation Anomalies
- **Time Series Visualizations**: Trends for temperature, rainfall, humidity, and anomalies.
- **Geo Maps**: Visualize metrics geographically to detect regional patterns or risks.
- **Model Comparison Charts**: Compare outputs from different weather/climate models (e.g., ENSEMBLE vs ERA5 vs SSP scenarios).
- **Drilldown Table**: Detailed daily records with exportable views for deeper analysis.

### üìå Example Use Cases

- Monitor historical and recent weather patterns across Madagascar
- Identify regions experiencing abnormal climate changes
- Support agricultural and environmental planning with data-backed insights
